PROJECT OVERVIEW:-
Heart Beat Detection and Monitoring System over
internet using Arduino that will detect the heart beat using the Pulse Sensor and
will show the readings in BPM (Beats Per Minute) on the LCD connected to it. It will
also send the readings to ThingSpeak server using the Wi-Fi module ESP8266, so
that Heart Beats can be monitored from anywhere in the world over the internet.
